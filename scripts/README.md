# Scripts

Project utility scripts.

- `install.sh`: user install helper for released Loopwire binaries; starts daemon immediately, registers auto-start, and sets up daily auto-update on macOS/Linux.
- `generate-types.sh`: generates TypeScript types from daemon JSON schema files.

Run from repo root when paths are referenced.
